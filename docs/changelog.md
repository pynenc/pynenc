## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-07

### Added

- **Plugin System Architecture**:

  - Introduced a comprehensive plugin system to support multiple backend implementations
  - Created plugin interface for state backends, brokers, and orchestrators
  - Enabled modular architecture for extending Pynenc with different storage and messaging systems

- **MongoDB Plugin Support**:

  - Added MongoDB as a new backend option through the plugin system
  - MongoDB plugin provides state backend, broker, and orchestrator implementations
  - Full feature parity with existing Redis functionality

- **Enhanced PynencBuilder Plugin Integration**:

  - Extended `PynencBuilder` with plugin method registration system via `register_plugin_method()`
  - Added plugin validator registration through `register_plugin_validator()`
  - Implemented dynamic method resolution for plugin-provided builder methods
  - Enhanced error handling with helpful messages for missing plugin methods
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for plugin system functionality

- **Builder System Improvements**:

  - Enhanced builder test coverage with comprehensive unit tests
  - Added validation for enum synchronization between builder and configuration classes
  - Added robust plugin method chaining and cleanup mechanisms

- **Enhanced Invocation History**:

  - Added `RunnerContext` class in `runner_context.py` to capture detailed runner execution context (hostname, PID, etc.) for task invocations.
  - Updated `InvocationHistory` in `base_state_backend.py` to include runner context for improved debugging and monitoring of task executions.

- **Test Coverage for ArgCache Implementations**:
  - Added `test_arg_cache_all_instances.py` to directly test abstract methods (`_store`, `_retrieve`, `_purge`) for all arg_cache implementations using the `app_instance` fixture.

### Changed

- **Redis Extraction to Plugin**:

  - **BREAKING CHANGE**: Redis is no longer included in the core Pynenc package
  - Redis functionality has been extracted to a separate `pynenc-redis` plugin package
  - Existing Redis-based applications will need to install `pynenc-redis` separately
  - Redis configuration and functionality remains unchanged once the plugin is installed

- **Orchestrator Architecture Optimization**:

  - **BREAKING CHANGE**: Orchestrator now works exclusively with invocations, call and task IDs
  - Objects are only serialized in the state backend to keep orchestrator lightweight
  - Runners are now more lightweight as they retrieve invocations from state backend only when necessary
  - Reduced memory consumption throughout Pynenc by using invocation_id in control structures
  - Removed state backend dependencies from orchestrator integration tests

- **Serializer**:

  - Default serializer changed from JSON to `jsonpickle` to preserve Python object types (e.g., NamedTuple) when persisting state and results.
  - Added `JsonPickleSerializer` implementation using the `jsonpickle` library.
  - Security note: `jsonpickle` can reconstruct arbitrary Python objects on deserialization â€” use it only for trusted, internal persistence (local state backends).

- **Plugin-Based Backend Selection**:

  - Backend selection now uses plugin discovery mechanism
  - Enhanced `PynencBuilder` to support plugin-based backend configuration
  - Improved error messages when required plugins are missing

- **Move Redis to a plugging**:

  - The Redis-related backend implementations were moved out of the core repository into plugin packages to simplify core distribution.
  - For testing process-compatible (non-memory) runners we recommend using a shared SQLite-backed state backend to enable cross-process coordination without adding external dependencies to the core.

- **Builder Architecture**:
  - Modified builder to support dynamic method registration from plugins
  - Added validation system for plugin-provided configuration
  - Enhanced builder to gracefully handle missing plugin dependencies

### Migration Guide

  ```bash
  pip install pynenc-redis
  ```
- **For MongoDB Users**: Install the new MongoDB plugin:
  ```bash
  pip install pynenc-mongodb
  ```
- **Code Changes**: No changes required to existing code once appropriate plugins are installed

### Technical

- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code remains functional with appropriate plugin installation
- **Plugin Interface**: Standardized interface for all backend implementations
- **Discovery Mechanism**: Automatic plugin discovery and registration system
- **Builder Extensions**: Plugin methods can extend builder functionality seamlessly

    - Context-aware generation using source task arguments, results, and status
  - Implemented conditional argument filtering mechanisms:
    - `ArgumentFilter`: Filter task execution based on original task arguments
    - `ResultFilter`: Conditionally trigger tasks based on specific result values
    - Event payload filtering for selective event-based execution
  - Each filter supports both static dictionary matching and dynamic callable functions:

  - Improved performance for high-volume task creation
  - Added cache key passthrough in arg_cache to prevent re-serialization of already cached values

- **Enhanced Redis Performance and Reliability**:

  - New Redis connection pool to efficiently reuse connections
  - Added InvocationIdentity for BaseInvocation to freeze only critical parameters and enable efficient caching
  - Implemented ThreadPoolExecutor in RedisOrchestrator to process pending status updates asynchronously
  - Added orchestrator methods `filter_final` and `filter_by_status` to efficiently filter invocations in batches
  - Improved DistributedInvocation with status caching to reduce Redis queries

- **Performance Testing and Analysis**:
  - Added Redis degradation tests to verify runner performance under high load conditions
  - Enhanced Redis debug client with summaries, tables, and call stack tracing for slow operations

### Changed

## [0.0.20] - 2025-03-21

### Added

- **New `PynencBuilder` for Enhanced Configuration**:
  - Introduced a fluent, chainable builder pattern for configuring Pynenc applications, replacing direct `Pynenc()` instantiation in examples and documentation.
  - Supports configuration of Redis/memory backends via `redis(url, db)` and `memory()`.
  - Offers multiple runner types: `multi_thread_runner(min_threads, max_threads, enforce_max_processes)`, `persistent_process_runner(num_processes)`, `thread_runner(min_threads, max_threads)`, `process_runner()`, and `dummy_runner()`.
  - Configures serializers with `serializer(name)` supporting shortnames (`json`, `pickle`) and full class names.
  - Adds fine-grained argument logging control with `hide_arguments()`, `show_argument_keys()`, `show_full_arguments()`, and `show_truncated_arguments(truncate_length=32)`, underpinned by `argument_print_mode(mode, truncate_length)`.
  - Enhances concurrency management with `concurrency_control(running_concurrency, registration_concurrency)`, accepting both strings and `ConcurrencyControlType` enums.
  - Includes additional utilities: `dev_mode(force_sync_tasks)`, `logging_level(level)`, `runner_tuning(...)`, `task_control(...)`, `max_pending_seconds(seconds)`, and `custom_config(**kwargs)`.
  - Validates memory component compatibility with runners via `_validate_memory_compatibility()`.
  - Comprehensive test suite covering all builder methods, including edge cases and enum validations.

## [0.0.19] - 2025-03-19

### Added

- **New `direct_task` Decorator**:
  - Introduced a new decorator `direct_task` in `Pynenc` that wraps the existing `task` decorator to provide a simpler interface for task execution.
  - Unlike `task`, which returns an invocation object, `direct_task` returns the result directly:
    - For synchronous functions, it waits and returns the result immediately.
    - For async functions, it returns an awaitable that resolves to the result.
  - Supports parallel execution with optional `parallel_func` (generates arguments for parallel tasks) and `aggregate_func` (combines results into a single value).
  - Inherits all options from `task` (e.g., `max_retries`, `retry_for`, `call_result_cache`), ensuring full compatibility with existing task configuration.
  - Example usage:

```python
    @app.direct_task
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y
    result = add(1, 2)  # Returns 3 directly

    @app.direct_task(parallel_func=lambda _: [(i, i+1) for i in range(5)], aggregate_func=sum)
    async def parallel_add(x, y):
    return x + y
    result = await parallel_add(0, 0)  # Returns 25 (sum of parallel results)
```

- **Comprehensive Tests for `direct_task`**:
- Added a new test file `tests/unit/task/test_direct_task.py` with full coverage for the `direct_task` decorator.

### Changed

- **Enhanced `ConcurrentInvocation` to Support Async Tasks**:
- Updated the `run` method in `ConcurrentInvocation` to use `run_task_sync`.
- Previously, async tasks were called directly without awaiting, returning a coroutine object. Now, `run_task_sync` detects async functions and runs them in a new event loop, ensuring the result is returned correctly.
- This fix ensures that `direct_task` and `task` decorators work seamlessly with async tasks in development environments (when `dev_mode_force_sync_tasks` is enabled), aligning its behavior with `DistributedInvocation`.

- Increased test coverage for `pynenc.util.import_app`.
- Increased test coverage for `pynenc.runner.persistent_process_runner`.

### Fixed

- **Corrected Async Task Execution in `ConcurrentInvocation`**:
- Fixed an issue where async tasks in a `ConcurrentInvocation` (used in dev mode) returned coroutine objects instead of results, breaking the `direct_task` decorator's promise of direct result return.
- The fix ensures compatibility with both sync and async tasks, improving reliability in test and development scenarios.

## [0.0.18] - 2025-03-06

### Added

- **Full support for asynchronous task execution and result retrieval**:

  - Introduced `async_result()` for **awaiting individual task results**.
  - Introduced `async_results()` for **awaiting multiple task results in parallel**.
  - Enabled **async group invocations** using `parallelize().async_results()`.

- **File Path Support in `find_app_instance`**: Enhanced `pynenc.util.import_app.find_app_instance` to support loading a `Pynenc` instance from a file path (e.g., `path/to/app.py`) in addition to module paths. The function now detects file paths using `os.path.sep` or `.py` extension, loads the module with `spec_from_file_location`, and adjusts `sys.path` for relative imports.
- **Enhanced `sys.path` Handling in `find_app_instance`**: For file paths, now adds the inferred project root (three levels up from the file) to `sys.path`, enabling nested imports (e.g., `from core.params.config_helpers import load_settings`) to resolve correctly, aligning with tools like Uvicorn.
- **Comprehensive Tests for File Path Loading**: Added `tests/unit/util/test_import_app_filepath.py` with full test coverage for `find_app_instance` file path functionality, including:
  - Successful loading with and without `.py` extension.
  - Error handling for nonexistent files, invalid module specs, and missing `Pynenc` instances.
  - Type hints for static type checking with `mypy`.
- **CLI Test for File Path Config**: Added `test_cli_show_config_with_file_path` to `tests/unit/cli/test_config_cli.py` to verify the CLI command `pynenc --app <file_path> show_config` loads and displays configuration from a file path.

- **PersistentProcessRunner**:
  - Introduced a new runner that maintains a fixed pool of persistent worker processes which continuously poll for invocations and execute them sequentially.
  - Workers receive shared communication arguments (via a managed dictionary passed in `runner_args`) to report waiting states, allowing the parent process to signal processes with SIGSTOP/SIGCONT.
  - This design reduces process startup overhead under heavy load and provides a more celery-like worker model for CPU-bound tasks.

### Tests

- **New unit tests for async result handling**:

  - Verified that `async_waiting_for_results()` correctly delegates to `_waiting_for_results()`.
  - Ensured that external invocations in `DummyRunner` use `time.sleep()` as expected.
  - Added tests for `async_result()` and `async_results()` behavior with **delayed and failing invocations**.

- **New integration tests for async execution**:

  - Full coverage of async task execution including:
    - **Simple async tasks**
    - **Async sleep-based tasks**
    - **Tasks raising exceptions**
    - **Tasks with async dependencies**
    - **Cycle detection in async tasks**
  - Group invocation tests verifying **async parallel execution**.

- **Enhanced test isolation in `conftest.py`:**

  - **Before**: Mocks were defined at the class level, leading to **state sharing** across tests.
  - **Now**: Each mock method is encapsulated **within the instance**, preventing **unexpected state persistence** in parallel test runs.
  - **Improved MockPynenc instantiation** to ensure each test gets **a fresh, isolated instance**.

- **Renamed `SynchronousInvocation` to `ConcurrentInvocation`:**

  - **Why?** The term _Synchronous_ was misleading since the class is designed for **concurrent execution**, not strictly _blocking synchronous_ execution.
  - **What changed?**
    - All references to `SynchronousInvocation` have been **replaced** with `ConcurrentInvocation`.
    - Code, documentation, and tests **updated accordingly** to reflect the new naming.
    - Ensured backward compatibility by **aliasing** `SynchronousInvocation` to `ConcurrentInvocation` (this will be removed in a future version).

- Added a unit test (`test_thread_start_failure`) that forces thread creation to fail and verifies that the invocation is correctly rerouted.
- Updated integration tests to cover asynchronous task execution, waiting, failure, dependency, and parallel performance.
- Added comprehensive performance tests to measure and validate task distribution efficiency.
- Implemented specific tests for the orchestrator's task acquisition mechanism.
- Added dedicated tests for the blocking control functionality to ensure proper invocation limits.
- Benchmarked runner performance under various load conditions.

### Changed

- Optimized `async_result()` to **improve polling efficiency** and reduce unnecessary orchestrator calls.
- Updated `async_waiting_for_results()` to **respect configurable sleep time** for better performance in distributed runners.

- Improved ThreadRunner error handling:

  - Wrapped thread creation in `runner_loop_iteration()` in try/except; on failure (RuntimeError), the offending invocation is requeued via `reroute_invocations`.
  - Enhanced cleanup of finished threads in the `available_threads` property by joining and removing them.
  - Clarified the use of `daemon=True` for threads (daemon threads wonâ€™t block process exit).
  - Slight adjustments to `_waiting_for_results` to continue polling the local final cache for dependency resolution.

- Updated ProcessRunner and MultiThreadRunner integration to support retrieving a shared cache when uninitialized.
- Improved argument cache purge logic to handle Manager.dict() shutdown cases gracefully.

- **Optimized `ThreadRunner` to poll local cache instead of pausing threads**:
  - **Before**: Used `threading.Condition` to pause threads in `_waiting_for_results`, relying on Redis status checks and condition notifications.
  - **Now**: Polls a local `OrderedDict` (`final_invocations`) to check for completed dependencies, reducing Redis queries and eliminating thread suspension overhead.
  - **Details**:
    - Removed `wait_conditions` and simplified `wait_invocation` to a `set` of collective dependencies.
    - Introduced `final_invocations` with a max size of 10,000 entries, evicting oldest entries when full.
    - Centralized status checks in `runner_loop_iteration`, populating the local cache and removing finalized invocations from `wait_invocation`.
    - Updated `_waiting_for_results` to poll the cache with a configurable sleep time (`invocation_wait_results_sleep_time_sec`), resuming tasks when all dependencies are final.
  - **Impact**: Improves performance by avoiding context switches, though it may slightly increase CPU usage due to polling. Memory is bounded by the cache size limit.

### Fixed

- **RedisOrchestrator Blocking Control**: Fixed an issue where the orchestrator was processing more invocations than requested, causing some runners to receive tasks they weren't executing. This improves resource allocation and prevents task queue overflow.

- **Fixed runner reference update in subprocesses:**

  - When a MultiThreadRunner spawns a ThreadRunner in a subprocess, the ThreadRunner now explicitly resets `app.runner` to itself.
  - This ensures that tasks executed within the subprocess use the correct runner instance, eliminating spurious warnings from `waiting_for_results`.

## [0.0.17] - 2025-03-04
