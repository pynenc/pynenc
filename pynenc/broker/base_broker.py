    An Abstract Base Class for Message Brokers in Pynenc**

    This class serves as the foundational structure for implementing various message brokers.
    It currently supports a simple FIFO queue and is extendable for more complex functionalities
    like priority queues and integration with different databases and message queues.

    :param Pynenc app: A reference to the Pynenc application.

    ```{note}
    The `BaseBroker` is currently implemented with an in-memory queue (`MemBroker`) for testing and demonstration,
    and a Redis-backed queue (`RedisBroker`) for production use.
    ```

    ```{attention}
    The implementation is currently limited to a FIFO queue. Future enhancements will include support
    for priority queues and compatibility with other databases and message queues like RabbitMQ.
    ```

    ```{hint}
    The class is designed to be flexible and expandable, allowing for easy integration of additional
    features and message brokers in the future.
    ```

    ```{seealso}
    For more advanced or production-ready features, refer to the specific implementations like `RedisBroker`.
    ```

    The `route_call` method creates a new invocation and routes it, demonstrating a basic usage of the broker.

    ### Examples
    ```{code-block} python
        # Assuming `app` is an instance of Pynenc and `call` is a valid Call object
        broker = BaseBroker(app)
        invocation = broker.route_call(call)
